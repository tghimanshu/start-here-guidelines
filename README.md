# Zero to Mastery - Start Here Guidelines

Welcome to the **Start Here Guidelines** repository! This is the starting point for your journey into open source contributions within the Zero to Mastery (ZTM) community.

## 🎯 Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to provide a **safe playground** for students and first-time contributors to practice the open source workflow. Here, you can learn how to:
-   Fork a repository
-   Clone it to your local machine
-   Create a branch
-   Make changes (commit)
-   Push changes
-   Create a Pull Request (PR)

We encourage you to "fail often" here so you can succeed in real-world projects later!

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get your name on the board and make your first contribution, follow these simple steps:
